This is the linker script for both standard images and XIP images.

 * K64F Flash configuration fields
 * These are 16 bytes, which must be loaded to address 0x400, and include
 * default protection and security settings.
 * They are loaded at reset to various Flash Memory module (FTFE) registers.
 */

/*
 * No need to account for this when running a RAM-only image since that
 * security feature resides in ROM.
